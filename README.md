A data analytics project that builds an end‑to‑end performance monitoring system for hospitals. It integrates raw operational data (admissions, departments, clinicians, beds, costs) into a clean analytics model and exposes Power BI dashboards for stakeholders to track hospital efficiency and outcomes.

Timeline: September 2025 – Present
Focus: Healthcare operations analytics — patient flow, bed utilization, cost of care, wait-time analysis

🩺 Project Overview

A data analytics project that builds an end‑to‑end performance monitoring system for hospitals. It integrates operational data (admissions, departments, clinicians, beds, costs) using SQL queries and Excel preprocessing, and exposes Power BI dashboards for stakeholders to track hospital efficiency and outcomes.

📊 Dashboards (Power BI)

Operations Overview: census, admissions/discharges, occupancy, ALOS

Quality & Outcomes: readmission rate, mortality proxy, case-mix

Financials: cost per case, revenue per bed-day, payer mix

Capacity & Flow: ER arrivals, LWBS, wait times, bottlenecks
