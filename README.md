# Hospital’s Performance Analysis  

![Dashboard](https://github.com/aryanchuadhary/Hospital-s-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-09-06%20161847.png)  

A data analytics project that builds an **end-to-end performance monitoring system for hospitals**.  
It integrates raw operational data (admissions, departments, clinicians, beds, costs) into a clean analytics model and exposes **Power BI dashboards** for stakeholders to track hospital efficiency and outcomes.  

**Timeline:** September 2025 – Present  
**Focus:** Healthcare operations analytics — patient flow, bed utilization, cost of care, wait-time analysis

## 🩺 Project Overview  

This project tracks and analyzes hospital operations by combining **Excel preprocessing**, **SQL queries**, and **Power BI dashboards**.  
It enables administrators and clinicians to monitor efficiency, reduce bottlenecks, and support **data-driven decision-making**.  

---

## 📊 Dashboards (Power BI)  

- **Operations Overview:** census, admissions/discharges, occupancy, ALOS  
- **Quality & Outcomes:** readmission rate, mortality proxy, case-mix  
- **Financials:** cost per case, revenue per bed-day, payer mix  
- **Capacity & Flow:** ER arrivals, LWBS, wait times, bottlenecks  

---

## 📁 Key Outcomes  

- Monitor KPIs: **Bed Utilization, Patient Throughput, ALOS, Readmission Rate, Avg. Treatment Cost, OPD/ER Wait Time**  
- Identify underperforming departments and cost leakage  
- Support **data-driven hospital operations** through interactive dashboards

## ✅ Sample Results (Demo Metrics)  

- Reduced **average ER wait time reporting error** to ±5 minutes  
- Identified **20% underutilized beds** in General Ward vs ICU  
- Highlighted **rising costs in Cardiology** with trend analysis
