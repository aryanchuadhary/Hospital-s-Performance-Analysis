# Hospital-s-Performance-Analysis
A data analytics project that builds an end‚Äëto‚Äëend performance monitoring system for hospitals. It integrates raw operational data (admissions, departments, clinicians, beds, costs) into a clean analytics model and exposes Power BI dashboards for stakeholders to track hospital efficiency and outcomes.

ü©∫ Project Overview

A data analytics project that builds an end‚Äëto‚Äëend performance monitoring system for hospitals. It integrates operational data (admissions, departments, clinicians, beds, costs) using SQL queries and Excel preprocessing, and exposes Power BI dashboards for stakeholders to track hospital efficiency and outcomes.

Key Outcomes

Monitor KPIs: Bed Utilization, Patient Throughput, ALOS, Readmission Rate, Avg. Treatment Cost, OPD/ER Wait Time

Identify underperforming departments and cost leakage

Support data-driven decision-making to improve hospital operations

‚ö†Ô∏è Data Privacy: Demo uses synthetic/de‚Äëidentified data. Replace with your organization‚Äôs data only if you have permission and follow HIPAA/GDPR/local regulations.

KPIs (Definitions)

Bed Utilization % = Occupied Bed-Days / Available Bed-Days

ALOS = Avg. (Discharge Date ‚àí Admit Date)

ER Wait Time = Arrival ‚Üí Physician start

Readmission Rate = 30‚Äëday returns / discharges

Cost per Case = Total cost / encounters

‚úÖ Sample Results (replace with your metrics)

Reduced average ER wait time reporting error to ¬±5 minutes

Identified 20% underutilized beds in General Ward vs ICU

Highlighted rising costs in Cardiology with visual trend analysis
